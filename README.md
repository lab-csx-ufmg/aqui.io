AQUI.io
=======

Aqui.io is coordinate shortener with support to any spatial reference system. Its accuracy ranges from 10m to 1cm. Unlike URL shortener services, such as bit.ly and goo.gl, the Aqui.io does not generate a hash code, but encodes the coordinates using a simple and fast algorithm. No precision is lost, and no permanent storage of codes is required. Any WGS84 coordinate can be encoded using 8 characters, while high-precision UTM coordinates take up to 14 characters. Applications aim at facilitating the integration of location data in social media and in volunteered geographic information applications.
